# Elibrary
# Abstract
This project aims to implement an electronic library system. It gives access to resources in library
to any visitor of the website and allows the librarian to maintain records of the books and members.
Nowadays libraries have a slightly digitized process for issuing books. There is a significant waste of
paper, and, moreover, the amount of space and time necessary for the maintenance of the records is
huge. An online management system represents the optimal solution for all of these problems, since
the data is easy to access or update and no resources are wasted.
Our application is designed to facilitate the experience for both the administrator and the members of
the library. The librarian can visualize, add, delete or edit any information about the books, authors,
publishers and members. The visitors have access to a list of all the books, such that they can check
if a certain title is available, without visiting the library. They only have to go, when they decided
they want one of the books. The issuing process is simple: the librarian register the deal, including
the return date. When the user brings back the book, the system checks if the return date is overdue
and calculates a fine if necessary.
The goal of the project is to implement an eco-friendly environment which helps libraries to provide
efficient services. We consider developing more features, such as access to e-books, to get even closer
to our goal.
